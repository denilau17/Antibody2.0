Antibody2.0
===========

Tool for more efficient analysis of Sanger sequencing of antibody genes using IMGT V-QUEST. Takes individual .seq files, combines them into a single text file in FASTA format and submits them to V-QUEST. It parses out the results in a .csv file that can be used for analysis in R.
